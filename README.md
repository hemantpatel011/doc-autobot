# Doc Autobot ðŸ¤–

**Doc Autobot** is a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline and automate the documentation process for your projects. It intelligently generates comprehensive and professional `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files by leveraging the capabilities of Gemini AI, ensuring your projects are well-documented and easy to understand for contributors and users alike.

`Note:`This documentation is also generated by this `doc-autobot` CLI tool.

## Features and Functionalities

*   **AI-Powered `README.md` Generation:** Automatically creates a detailed `README.md` file by analyzing your project's content, utilizing Gemini AI for intelligent and context-aware documentation.
*   **Templated `CONTRIBUTING.md` Generation:** Generates a standard `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, providing clear guidelines for potential contributors on how to get started, fork, commit, and submit pull requests.
*   **Flexible CLI Commands:**
    *   `doc-autobot readme`: Generates only the `README.md` file.
    *   `doc-autobot contributing`: Generates only the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    *   `doc-autobot both`: Generates both `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files.
*   **Interactive Wizard Mode:** Simply run `doc-autobot` without any arguments to launch an interactive wizard that guides you through the process of choosing which documentation files to generate.
*   **Automatic Project Context Detection:** Automatically detects project details such as name, description, author, license, and dependencies from `package.json` to inform the documentation generation.

## Available npm/yarn Scripts

*   `npm start`: Runs the `index.js` file directly (primarily for development/testing).

## Installation Steps

Doc Autobot is a Node.js CLI tool. To use it, you need to have Node.js installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
*   npm or Yarn package manager

### Global Installation (Recommended)

To use `doc-autobot` globally across your system, install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install -g doc-autobot
# OR
yarn global add doc-autobot
```

After global installation, you can run the commands directly from project `Root` directory:

```bash
doc-autobot
doc-autobot readme
doc-autobot contributing
doc-autobot both
```

### Local Installation (for project-specific use or development)

If you prefer to install it as a development dependency for a specific project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev doc-autobot
# OR
yarn add --dev doc-autobot
```

Then, you can run it using `npx` (if installed with npm) or by defining a script in your `package.json`:

```bash
npx doc-autobot
npx doc-autobot readme
npx doc-autobot contributing
npx doc-autobot both
```

## Tech Stack

*   **Node.js**: The runtime environment for the CLI.
*   **JavaScript (ESM)**: The programming language used.
*   **Gemini AI (`@google/generative-ai`)**: Powers the intelligent `README.md` generation.
*   **Commander.js**: For building the command-line interface.
*   **Inquirer.js**: For creating interactive command-line prompts and the wizard mode.
*   **Chalk**: For colorful console output.
*   **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
*   **FS-Extra**: For extended file system operations.

## Environment Variables

To enable the AI-powered `README.md` generation, you must set the following environment variable:

*   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google Gemini. Obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `doc-autobot` project (or wherever you run the CLI from, if installed locally) and add your key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
```
