### üîç What is Doc Autobot?

Doc Autobot ü§ñ is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to save developers from the pain of writing boilerplate documentation.

Its main job is to automatically generate two essential files every project needs:

- `README.md` ‚Üí The main documentation file for your project.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` ‚Üí Guidelines for contributors.

Instead of starting from scratch, Doc Autobot uses Google Gemini AI to analyze your project, fetch details like package.json, and instantly create professional, context-aware, ready-to-use docs.

### ‚ö° Why Doc Autobot?

We all know this struggle:

- Writing good documentation is boring and time-consuming.
- A missing or poor README makes projects look unprofessional.
- Every open-source project needs at least a README + CONTRIBUTING guide.

üëâ Doc Autobot removes that friction ‚Äî by generating high-quality documentation instantly, intelligently, and consistently.

### üåü Why It‚Äôs Useful

- Saves hours of manual writing.
- Helps beginners maintain professional-looking projects.
- Standardizes docs across repositories.
- Perfect for open-source maintainers, hackathons, and students.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered `README.md` Generation:** Automatically creates a detailed `README.md` by analyzing your project's content.
*   **Templated `CONTRIBUTING.md` Generation:** Quickly generates a standard `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
*   **Interactive Wizard**: If you run the tool without commands, a user-friendly wizard guides you through the options.
*   **Multiple Commands**: Offers dedicated commands for generating specific files.
*   **Project Context Awareness**: Fetches details from `package.json` to inform documentation generation.
*   **Tech Stack Agnostic**: Useful for any type of project.
