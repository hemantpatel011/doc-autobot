**Doc Autobot** is a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline and automate the documentation process specifically `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files for your projects. Leveraging the capabilities of Gemini AI, Doc Autobot streamlines the documentation process, helping developers quickly create comprehensive, professional, and consistent documentation for their projects.

`Note:`This documentation is also generated by this `doc-autobot` CLI tool.


## Features and Functionalities

*   **AI-Powered `README.md` Generation:** Automatically creates a detailed `README.md` file by analyzing your project's content, utilizing Gemini AI for intelligent and context-aware documentation.
*   **Templated `CONTRIBUTING.md` Generation:** Generates a standard `CONTRIBUTING.md` file from a predefined template, providing clear guidelines for potential contributors on how to get started, fork, commit, and submit pull requests.
*   **Multiple CLI Commands**: Offers dedicated commands for generating `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or both simultaneously.
    *   `doc-autobot readme`: Generate only `README.md`.
    *   `doc-autobot contributing`: Generate only `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    *   `doc-autobot both`: Generate both `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   **Interactive Wizard**: Provides a user-friendly, wizard-like experience when run without specific commands, allowing users to choose which files to generate.
*   **Project Context Awareness**: Automatically fetches project details like name, description, and dependencies from `package.json` to inform documentation generation.
*   **For All Tech Stack**: Tailored to assist in generating documentation for all tech stack projects, though versatile enough for all project types.


## Available npm/yarn Scripts

*   `npm start`: Runs the `index.js` file directly (primarily for development/testing).

## Installation Steps

Doc Autobot is a Node.js CLI tool. To use it, you need to have Node.js installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
*   npm or Yarn package manager

### Global Installation (Recommended)

To use `doc-autobot` globally across your system, install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install -g doc-autobot
# OR
yarn global add doc-autobot
```

After global installation, you can run the commands directly from project `Root` directory:

```bash
doc-autobot
doc-autobot readme
doc-autobot contributing
doc-autobot both
```

### Without Global Installation (for project-specific use )

You can run it using `npx`:

```bash
npx doc-autobot
npx doc-autobot readme
npx doc-autobot contributing
npx doc-autobot both
```

## Tech Stack

*   **Node.js**: The runtime environment for the CLI.
*   **JavaScript (ESM)**: The programming language used.
*   **Gemini AI (`@google/generative-ai`)**: Powers the intelligent `README.md` generation.
*   **Commander.js**: For building the command-line interface.
*   **Inquirer.js**: For creating interactive command-line prompts and the wizard mode.
*   **Chalk**: For colorful console output.
*   **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
*   **FS-Extra**: For extended file system operations.

## Environment Variables

To enable the AI-powered `README.md` generation, you must set the following environment variable:

*   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google Gemini. Obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `doc-autobot` project (or wherever you run the CLI from, if installed locally) and add your key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
```
